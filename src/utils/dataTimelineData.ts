        description: "- It is a short-lived tale.\n- I joined there as a Software Engineer (Trainee) on July 15, 2024, and I was learning WordPress development there as it is one of the best WordPress website development agencies.\n- My opinion may differ from other trainees of my batch, but I felt very overworked there, and the main part which I didn’t like there was that we were treated like college kids, and I felt very overworked. The rtCamp I read in their handbook was quite the opposite over there (especially in the training), and since I didn’t do any development in the past 1 year, I was just catching up with the things.\n- I still committed myself to giving at least 1-2 years to see how things would roll out and shifted my gears for growth. But there was a big blocker, and that was Q&A like the viva in college (happened every week or two on the first day of the week), and in preparation for that, I used to give up my weekends and had to work on the week for straight 12 hrs, contrary to the 8 hrs work because I was always left behind, and my work was not always up to their expectations as they had a reputation to maintain and expected the same level of work from me.\n- And due to my low performance over there, I was shifted to PIP of 1 week, and someone who is struggling and trying, one week was very low to submit work as per their expectation, and the difficulties of the modules were also increasing in the meantime.\n- I didn’t do well, so I had to leave on Sep 10, 2024.\n- Well, in that period, I learnt a lot. If I am being completely honest, I started blogging daily about my learning. I got to see how CI/CD works from the outside. I today know every basic thing about git which a developer needs to know. I liked that more compared to WordPress Development, and it made me curious about that.\n- That’s when I decided to debunk every web-related topic after rtCamp.",

        description: "- When I got out of rtCamp, I was completely devastated to see that it actually happened. I took it very personally as I failed over there in a professional setting and was exhausted as I used to work 7 days/week just to get bare minimum marks.\n- So I thought of taking a break and going to my hometown, which is around 500 kms from my place of residence. I drove up and down that route and in my hometown to visit different places as I went there during Durga Puja and Diwali. So I travelled a lot and made some friends over there.\n- I got back to Siliguri, and since there are many hill stations from here, I visited them on my friend’s bike. I can easily say that I drove that bike for around 500-600 kms in total in pursuit of that. I went to Darjeeling 3 times in one single month with different routes, went to Kalimpong, Kurseong, and drove along the roads beside the Teesta river. As a local, you get the benefit when you need some break. \n- During navigation I saw a lot of gaps that AndroidAuto and GoogleMaps together could solve because even bikes today support digital screens",

(CTC was also 8 Lakhs only)\n\t- The initial joining date was July 2024, but due to business challenges, they shifted the date to Jan 2025.",

        description: "- I did all this in a span of 5 months. As I told you, I had some timeline for placements and didn’t do any development, so I thought it was time to take care of my body and started working on that.\n- Gym never appealed to me a lot before, so I took up other sports for that where I enjoyed the process also. So, I learnt Squash (as it was less competitive and crowded in college as it is an expensive game and requires maintenance).\n- Once I became good at Squash, it was hard to convince others to play this game who were at my level (because I played terribly in it). So, I improved my game a lot due to that, but I was still behind many players.\n- So, to keep the fun going, I started playing badminton, which was very competitive and crowded, but I cracked the timing and saw that in the morning (4 a.m. to 6 a.m.) it used to be empty and post 9 p.m. in the night it used to be empty. So, I started playing in those slots and the rest of the time I dedicated to Squash. I was all day playing and trying new sports.\n- I used to walk around 10,000 steps daily in college. Evening walks with friends were the amazing part.\n- I also started running in the last few months of college days (avg 5:40 minutes/km) and recorded each run on Strava to increase my agility in the game because again I was terrible at badminton too, so increasing the stamina and agility gave me some edge to judge opponents and act on them easily.\n- I also went on cycling rides during the weekend, and it was always more than 20 kms. The longest I did in college was 80 kms. With all the running effort, cycling was easy for me.\n- I did utilize my time to the fullest and gave focus on one single goal, and that was to enjoy as much as possible in this journey.\n- And on that note, that’s how my 4 years of college were completed.",
