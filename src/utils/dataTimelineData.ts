        description: "- Before starting out, I took a timeline that I had to get placed in the month of August 2023, and that’s how it all started.\n- Started thinking that the first company which would be coming in that I would be placed because I worked tirelessly and gave my all in the past few years.\n- The D arrived and didn’t portray myself in the best way possible.\n- Rejected at many steps, and when I reached the interview stages, I think these could be the reasons for getting rejections:\n\t- ZS Associates (applied for DAA role and gave an interview like a tech person)\n\t- Mastercard (Round 2 technical, got too nervous when I couldn’t explain a lot)\n\t- Transunion (even I don’t know the reason)\n- 3 times in a row rejection that also occurred within 1 week, compelled me to get placed somehow in the next interview.\n\t- Got placed in Varasi (only one in the college)\n\t- Because it was a Salesforce Dev role job, the bar of competition was low, and evaluating now, even I don’t know how I convinced myself for that role because I had no previous work experience in that field.\n\t- Rs. 8 Lakhs in-hand yearly package with Rs. 12,000 internet cost. (CTC was also 8 Lakhs only)\n\t- The initial joining date was July 2024, but due to business challenges, they shifted the date to Jan 2025.",

        description: "- As I was not satisfied with my previous placements, I looked for new opportunities in different roles and luckily got an interview call from rtCamp (and that’s how it all started).\n- To be honest, I didn’t know about so many concepts of web development before that day, so I looked for rtCamp interview questions on Glassdoor (I looked on Google before every interview) and started preparing the topics.\n- And again, luckily and with a mix of right and wrong answers in the interview, I got selected at rtCamp (Sep 2024).\n- The joining date was Apr ’24 (6 months probation for Rs. 50,000 monthly and in-hand Rs. 1 Lakh monthly offer post probation).\n- Later on, the date shifted to July ’24.\n- And once I got this opportunity, I stopped applying to any other company and left development altogether and focused mainly on BE project and on my health.",

My vision with this project was to automate parking because in India, we have a lot of parking problems and a lot of human effort goes into parking management.\n- Since I was building this project only for the project and not for shipping, it never came as a foolproof plan; it was always only upto the requirements and nothing else above that.",

        description: "- I did all this in a span of 5 months. As I told you, I had some timeline for placements and didn’t do any development, so I thought it was time to take care of my body and started working on that.\n- Gym never appealed to me a lot before, so I took up other sports for that where I enjoyed the process also. So, I learnt Squash (as it was less competitive and crowded in college as it is an expensive game and requires maintenance).\n- Once I became good at Squash, it was hard to convince others to play this game who were at my level (because I played terribly in it). So, I improved my game a lot due to that, but I was still behind many players.\n- So, to keep the fun going, I started playing badminton, which was very competitive and crowded, but I cracked the timing and saw that in the morning (4 a.m. to 6 a.m.) it used to be empty and post 9 p.m. in the night it used to be empty. So, I started playing in those slots and the rest of the time I dedicated to Squash. I was all day playing and trying new sports.\n- I used to walk around 10,000 steps daily in college. Evening walks with friends were the amazing part.\n- I also started running in the last few months of college days (avg 5:40 mins/km) and recorded each run on Strava to increase my agility in the game because again I was terrible at badminton too, so increasing the stamina and agility gave me some edge to judge opponents and act on them easily.\n- I also went on cycling rides during the weekend, and it was always more than 20 kms. The longest I did in college was 80 kms. With all the running effort, cycling was easy for me.\n- I did utilize my time to the fullest and gave focus on one single goal, and that was to enjoy as much as possible in this journey.\n- And on that note, that’s how my 4 years of college were completed.",
