        description: "- It is a short-lived tale.\n- I joined there as a Software Engineer (Trainee) on July 15, 2024, and I was learning WordPress development there as it is one of the best WordPress website development agencies.\n- My opinion may differ from other trainees of my batch, but I felt very overworked there, and the main part which I didn’t like there was that we were treated like college kids, and I felt very overworked. The rtCamp I read in their handbook was quite the opposite over there (especially in the training), and since I didn’t do any development in the past 1 year, I was just catching up with the things.\n- I still committed myself to giving at least 1-2 years to see how things would roll out and shifted my gears for growth. But there was a big blocker, and that was Q&A like the viva in college (happened every week or two on the first day of the week), and in preparation for that, I used to give up my weekends and had to work on the week for straight 12 hrs, contrary to the 8 hrs work because I was always left behind, and my work was not always up to their expectations as they had a reputation to maintain and expected the same level of work from me.\n- And due to my low performance over there, I was shifted to PIP of 1 week, and someone who is struggling and trying, one week was very low to submit work as per their expectation, and the difficulties of the modules were also increasing in the meantime.\n- I didn’t do well, so I had to leave on Sep 10, 2024.\n- Well, in that period, I learnt a lot. If I am being completely honest, I started blogging daily about my learning. I got to see how CI/CD works from the outside. I today know every basic thing about git which a developer needs to know. I liked that more compared to WordPress Development, and it made me curious about that.\n- That’s when I decided to debunk every web-related topic after rtCamp.",

I took it very personally as I failed over there in a professional setting and was exhausted as I used to work 7 days/week just to get bare minimum marks.\n- So I thought of taking a break and going to my hometown, which is around 500 kms from my place of residence. I drove up and down that route and in my hometown to visit different places as I went there during Durga Puja and Diwali. So I travelled a lot and made some friends over there.\n- I got back to Siliguri, and since there are many hill stations from here, I visited them on my friend’s bike. I can easily say that I drove that bike for around 500-600 kms in total in pursuit of that. I went to Darjeeling 3 times in one single month with different routes, went to Kalimpong, Kurseong, and drove along the roads beside the Teesta river. As a local, you get the benefit when you need some break. \n- During navigation I saw a lot of gaps that AndroidAuto and GoogleMaps together could solve because even bikes today support digital screens",

As I told you, I had some timeline for placements and didn’t do any development, so I thought it was time to take care of my body and started working on that.\n- Gym never appealed to me a lot before, so I took up other sports for that where I enjoyed the process also. So, I learnt Squash (as it was less competitive and crowded in college as it is an expensive game and requires maintenance).\n- Once I became good at Squash, it was hard to convince others to play this game who were at my level (because I played terribly in it). So, I improved my game a lot due to that, but I was still behind many players.\n- So, to keep the fun going, I started playing badminton, which was very competitive and crowded, but I cracked the timing and saw that in the morning (4 a.m. to 6 a.m.) it used to be empty and post 9 p.m. in the night it used to be empty. So, I started playing in those slots and the rest of the time I dedicated to Squash. I was all day playing and trying new sports.\n- I used to walk around 10,000 steps daily in college. Evening walks with friends were the amazing part.\n- I also started running in the last few months of college days (avg 5:40 minutes/km) and recorded each run on Strava to increase my agility in the game because again I was terrible at badminton too, so increasing the stamina and agility gave me some edge to judge opponents and act on them easily.\n- I also went on cycling rides during the weekend, and it was always more than 20 kms. The longest I did in college was 80 kms. With all the running effort, cycling was easy for me.\n- I did utilize my time to the fullest and gave focus on one single goal, and that was to enjoy as much as possible in this journey.\n- And on that note, that’s how my 4 years of college were completed.",

The legacy they left to continue was amazing.\n- As a GDSC Lead, you are the PoC for your campus, and there were around 500+ GDSC campuses registered in India at that time, so it was a precious position at that time and gives you a lot of networking ability and open doors for opportunities if you can grab it.\n- When I became Lead, I made friends out of my college and someone who was not from that region, made some regional friends over there and called ourselves the Leads of GDSC Pune.\n- As a Lead, you had a few goals in a year to do. Basically, Google has its own programs to promote such as Android Study Jams, Cloud Study Jams or Arcade, and other programs for Flutter, Angular, and other related Google technologies. \n- We as a Lead were tasked to bring awareness about the program and had to reach certain milestones to be recognized. I still wonder why we didn't promote Golang for Backend technology\n- I myself conducted many study sessions on Android, and there were other domain heads who taught other Google technologies.\n- The programs were focused on one conclusion, and that was Google Solution Challenge where 17 Sustainable Development Goals were the theme for the same.\n- Our college students never made it to the top 50 teams, but I as a Lead pushed a lot to promote each and every program for their self-growth, and due to that, I lost track of my own development time, but it was a great opportunity as we focused on college problems and shortlisted a few pain points and asked students to build solutions on top of it to solve the issue, but due to time constraint, that was never fulfilled successfully.\n- In the end, we were rewarded with a Graduation ceremony at Bangalore, and it was grand, and more than 400 people (estimated) attended that, and the journey as a Lead came to an end.",
